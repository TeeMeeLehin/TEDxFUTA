                Everyone wants to be a champion, I guess I know a quick fix.
                Care to know? Dive in! There’s been a lot of talks lately about
                the future of education: is education steering towards skill or
                degree? Which of these do you think the future world would
                support? What is sustainable education and how do we create it?
                In this post, we would look into what sustainable education is,
                lay bare how sustainability can be adopted in the educational
                system, and finally decide on what the future of education would
                be; Skills or Degree? Let’s scrap in and get going.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                <span class="red">What is Sustainable Education?</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                First, sustainable education is not the same thing as education
                for sustainability which is about teaching the cores of
                sustainability. Sustainable education is kinda practical. It is
                about finding long-lasting solutions to social, environmental,
                and economic issues. I will say, this is about using whatever
                kind of education you have to proffer sustainable solutions to
                pressing issues in our communities. Education in this case could
                be our degrees or skills we have learned and developed.Now that
                we have understood what sustainable education is, I need you to
                think about how we can achieve this. Will our degrees, lessons
                learned in school do the job, or do we need some saving grace
                called skills? A degree or skills? How would we proffer
                long-lasting solutions to our society's pressing needs?
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                <span class="red">Degree or Skills</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                Now that we have understood what sustainable education is, I
                need you to think about how we can achieve this. Will our
                degrees, lessons learned in school do the job, or do we need
                some saving grace called skills? A degree or skills? How would
                we proffer long-lasting solutions to our society's pressing
                needs?

                However, the students of the 21st century are expected to
                develop and grow higher-order thinking skills, engaging
                knowledge in flexible and creative ways. They are also required
                to demonstrate advanced scientific thinking, analyze conflicting
                evidence, and make calculated and informed decisions to solve a
                wide variety of real-life problems. In addition, to solve
                pressing issues in society, they are needed to develop
                higher-order social skills in order to collaborate and negotiate
                with other people, and respect social diversity. They need to
                develop communication and literacy skills, allowing them to
                process information.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is widely known that companies are looking for individuals
                who know their onions and hiring managers tend to put skills
                above your degree. Is this really so? Have you ever come across
                a job post that needed a certain type of degree to have an edge?
                Take a writing freelancing gig as a case study, writing skills
                can be developed but then, most clients appreciate those with a
                Bachelor in English, Arts, or even Communication.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                <span class="red"
                  >What would be your choice? Degree, Skills or both?</span
                >
                <br />
                <br />
                In sustainable education, students acquire what is necessary and
                useful to address their own, and society’s, present and future
                needs: students acquire these competencies to full-blown,
                sustainable levels, that is, to an extent that the competencies
                are truly incorporated and can be further developed later on in
                life.
                <br />
                <br />
                Conclusively, the future of education will be to incorporate
                both soft and industry-required skills into our orthodox
                educational structure, that is, while we pursue a degree, we add
                skills to it. Let me tell you something you can start doing.
                TedX is a program of self-organized events that bring people
                together to share technology, entertainment, and design-like
                experiences. To achieve this, it will require the collaboration
                of different people. It will also provide a space to learn and
                build some of these skills. You should consider joining our
                volunteer family to get started.
